# Weekly Test 2

## Index.html

The "index.html" file is the primary HTML document that establishes the foundation of webpage. It has two iframes, each responsible for displaying distinct content.

### Left Side

The left side iframe is designated to showcase content sourced from the "left-side.html" file.

### Right Side

 the right side iframe is utilized to present content from an external website, specifically from the URL "https://saifulislam05.github.io/resume/". The `name` attribute of this iframe is set to "right-side." Consequently, this attribute is used as a target for hyperlinks contained within the left-side iframe. Clicking on such links will trigger the opening of content within the right-side iframe on the main page.

## Left-side.html

The "left-side.html" file is a list of projects. Each project has pictures and links.

### Project 1 - Resume

In this segment, the `<p>` tag is deployed to exhibit the textual content "Project 1 - Resume". An `<a>` tag encapsulates an image representing a resume, and this tag is linked to the URL "https://saifulislam05.github.io/resume/". The "target" attribute of the `<a> `tag is established as "right-side". This attribute signifies that when a user clicks on this link, the linked content will be displayed within the right-side iframe on the primary webpage.

### Project 2 - Photo Cat App

Following a similar approach to the previous project, this section integrates a hyperlink leading to a cat photo app webpage. An image related to the cat photo app is incorporated, and the `<a>` tag features a link to "https://saifulislam05.github.io/cat-photo-app/". The `target` attribute is specified as "right-side", indicating that clicking on this link will render the linked content within the right-side iframe.

### Project 3 - HTML Form

This section provides a link to an HTML form page. An accompanying image is included, and the `<a>` tag within this section points to "https://saifulislam05.github.io/html-form/". Similar to previous instances, the "target" attribute is set to "right-side".

### Project 4 - Tribute Page

The final project segment encompasses a link directing to a tribute page. An associated image is featured, and the `<a>` tag's hyperlink is directed to "https://saifulislam05.github.io/tribute-page/". The "target" attribute is configured as "right-side".

Each project section employs consistent structural elements, with `<p>` tags for project titles, `<a>` tags for hyperlinks, and `<img>` tags for displaying associated images.
