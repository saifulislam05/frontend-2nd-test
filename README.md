## Project Overview

This project consists of a simple webpage designed using HTML to showcase different projects and their details. The main purpose is to demonstrate how iframes and various HTML tags can be utilized to create an informative and interactive webpage.

## Understanding the Files

### Index.html

The "index.html" file is the primary HTML document that lays the foundation for the webpage. It features two iframes, acting as distinct windows to display different content sections.

#### Left Side

The left-side iframe presents content from the "left-side.html" file. This area can be used for navigation or displaying related links.

#### Right Side

The right-side iframe displays content from an external website, specifically from "https://saifulislam05.github.io/resume/". The iframe is labeled with the `name` attribute "right-side," ensuring that links from the left side open within this right-side window.

### Left-side.html

The "left-side.html" file serves as a catalog of projects, each with relevant images and corresponding links.

#### Project 1 - Resume

This section uses a paragraph tag `<p>` to display "Project 1 - Resume". An anchor tag `<a>` surrounds an image that represents a resume. Clicking the image takes users to "https://saifulislam05.github.io/resume/" in the right-side iframe.

#### Project 2 - Photo Cat App

Similarly, this section features a linked image that directs users to a cat photo app page.

#### Project 3 - HTML Form

This section provides a link to an HTML form page.

#### Project 4 - Tribute Page

The final project section encompasses a link directing to a tribute page.
